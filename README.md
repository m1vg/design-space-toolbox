Design Space Toolbox (C Library)
==============================================

The Design Space Toolbox is a library for analysis of mechanistic models of biochemical systems.  This library automates the difficult steps within the System Design Space Approach by combining symbolic and numerical methods for the analysis of systems composed of ordinary differential equations.

The library includes a computer algebra system for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions and numerical methods for the analysis and visualization of model behaviors.
